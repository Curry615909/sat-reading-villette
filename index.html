<br>
<p>One afternoon, Mrs. Bretton, <mark>coaxing 哄劝</mark> [Paulina] from her usual station in a corner, h <u>ad lifted her into the window-seat , and, by way of occupying her attention, told her to watch the passenger s and count how many ladies should go down the street in a given time.让小女孩数经过的路人</u> She had sat <mark>listlessly 无精打采的</mark>, hardly looking, and <b>not counting</b>, when—my eye being fixed on hers—I witnessed in its iris and pupil a <mark>startling 令人吃惊的</mark> <mark>transfiguration 变形</mark>. These sudden, dangerous natures—<i>sensitive</i>as they are called—offer many a curious <mark>spectacle 奇观</mark> to those whom a cooler <mark>temperament 性情</mark> has secured from participation in their angular vagaries. The fixed and heavy gaze swum, trembled, then <mark>glittered 闪光</mark> in fire; the small, overcast brow cleared; the trivial and <mark>dejected 沮丧的</mark> features lit up; the sad countenance vanished, and in its place appeared a sudden eagerness, anintense expectancy. “It <i>is!</i>” were her words. </p>
<br>
<p>Like a bird or a shaft, or any other swift thing, she was gone from the room. How she got the house-door open I cannot tell; probably it might be <mark>ajar 微开着的</mark>; perhaps Warren was in the way and obeyed her behest, which would be <mark>impetuous 鲁莽的</mark> enough. I—watching calmly from the window—saw her, in her black frock and tiny braided apron (to pinafores she had an antipathy), <mark>dart 猛冲</mark> half the length of the street; and, as I was on the point of turning, and quietly announcing to Mrs. Bretton that the child was run out mad, and ought instantly to be pursued, I saw her caught up, and rapt at once from my cool observation, and from the wondering stare of the passengers. <u>A gentleman had done this good turn, and now, covering her with his cloak, advanced to restore her to the house whence he had seen her issue. 作者以为这个人是陌生人</u> </p>
<br>
<p><u>I concluded he would leave her in a servant’s charge and withdraw; but he entered: having <mark>tarried 逗留</mark> a little while below, he came up-stairs.</u> </p>
<br>
<p>His reception immediately explained that <u>he was known to Mrs. Bretton 俩人认识</u>. She recognised him; she greeted him, and yet she was fluttered, surprised, taken unawares. Her look and manner were even expostulatory; and in reply to these, rather than her words, he said,—”I could not help it, madam: I found it impossible to leave the country without seeing with my own eyes how she settled.” </p>
<br>
<p>“But you will unsettle her.”</p>
<br>
<p>“I hope not. And how is papa’s little Polly?” </p>
<br>
<p>This question he addressed to Paulina, as he sat down and placed her gently on the ground before him. </p>
<br>
<p>“How is Polly’s papa?” was the reply, as she leaned on his knee, and gazed up into his face.</p>
<br>
<p>It was not a noisy, not a wordy scene: for that I was thankful; but it was a scene of feeling too brimful, and which, because the cup did not foam up high or furiously overflow, only oppressed one the more. On all occasions of <mark>vehement 强烈的</mark>, <mark>unrestrained 无节制的</mark> expansion, a sense of <mark>disdain 鄙视</mark> or ridicule comes to the weary spectator’s relief; whereas I have ever felt most burdensome that sort of sensibility which bends of its own will, a giant slave under the sway of good sense. </p>
<br>
<p>Mr. Home was a stern-featured—perhaps I should rather say, a hard-featured man: his forehead was knotty, and his cheekbones were marked and prominent. The character of his face was quite Scotch; but there was feeling in his eye, and emotion in his now <mark>agitated 焦虑</mark> countenance. His northern accent in speaking harmonised with his physiognomy. <u>He was at once proud-looking and homely-looking.</u> He laid his hand on the child’s uplifted head. She said—”Kiss Polly.” </p>
<br>
<p>He kissed her. I wished she would utter some hysterical cry, so that I might get relief and be at ease. <u>She made wonderfully little noise: she seemed to have got what she wanted—all she wanted, and to be in a trance of content. 很满意</u> Neither in <mark>mien 风度</mark> nor in features was this creature like her sire, and yet she was of his strain: her mind had been filled from his, as the cup from the flagon. </p>
